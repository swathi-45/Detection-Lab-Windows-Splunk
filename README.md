## Day 01: Windows + Splunk Setup

**Objective:**  
Set up a SOC lab on Windows 10 with Splunk Enterprise, verify Windows Security logs, and capture evidence of lab readiness.  

**Summary of Work:**  
- Installed Windows 10 VM on VirtualBox.  
- Installed Splunk Enterprise on Windows 10 and accessed the web dashboard.  
- Explored Windows Event Viewer → Security logs.  
- Filtered and inspected authentication events (failed logons).  
- Documented all actions, observations, and evidence in a PDF.  

**Artifacts:**  
- [SOC-Lab-Day01-Windows-Splunk.pdf](./Day01/SOC-Lab-Day01-Windows-Splunk.pdf) — Full documentation with screenshots and notes.  

**Learning Outcome:**  
- Verified working Windows + Splunk SOC lab.  
- Confirmed access to Windows Security logs.  
- Developed a habit of evidence-first documentation, ready for SOC interviews.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Analyze one Windows authentication event in depth.  
- Translate coded log fields (like %%2304) into meaning.  
- Ingest Windows logs into Splunk for search and analysis.
